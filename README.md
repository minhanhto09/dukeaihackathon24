## Key Features

### Optimal Time Block Suggestions
    
PeakPlanner intelligently integrates both health data (e.g., sleep, productivity, menstrual cycles, energy levels, etc) and schedule data (e.g., deadlines, fixed events) to suggest the best time blocks for high-priority tasks. The system aligns important deadlines with times when you are naturally more alert and focused, preventing last-minute stress and maximizing efficiency.
