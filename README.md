# LLM-Based Schedule Optimizer - PeakPlanner

PeakPlanner is an intelligent system designed to optimize your study and work schedules based on your personal health and productivity data, allowing for more efficient task management and healthier routines.

## Functionality

### Time Block Recommendations:
    
Using both health and schedule data, the LLM suggests time blocks for completing tasks based on the user’s condition and productivity levels. For high-priority deadlines, it ensures sufficient time allocation on optimal days to prevent last-minute cramming.
        
    Example: If a user needs 5 hours for homework on a particular Thursday and 10 hours to prepare for an exam, the LLM will schedule study sessions in alignment with the user's “optimal” state for focus and productivity.

### Task Tracking and Habit Formation:

At the end of each day, the user can log their task completion. This feedback helps the LLM monitor time spent on each task and adjust future recommendations based on the user's performance.

## Future Enhancements

### Enhanced Health Data Tracking:

Integrate additional health metrics like exercise duration and physical activity data.

# Comprehensive Scheduling Options:
Add scheduling for local events, gym sessions, and meditation blocks.

# Peak Productivity Predictions:
Develop functionality to identify and suggest time frames when the user is likely to be most productive.
